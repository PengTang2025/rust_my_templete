# Assignment 3: Configure Visual Studio Code with Codespaces

This is the last assignment for this week. In this assignment, you'll configure [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza) with [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview). 

### Steps
1. Use Visual Studio Code to create a new Codespace configuration with dev containers.
2. Use the Rust image for the configuration
3. Add the Rust Analyzer and GitHub Copilot extensions to the configuration.

### Artifacts
1. A GitHub repository with a `.devcontainer` directory with the configuration files for your Codespace.
2. A `README.md` file that describes the configuration and how to use it.
3. The repository has to be fully functional with Codespaces and you should be able to run it from the browser.
